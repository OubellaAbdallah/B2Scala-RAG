tion, session key generation, and ticket encryption. Subsequently, communication
with party B ensues, facilitated by the transmission of the encrypted ticket, along
with nonces to ensure freshness. Parties exchange messages encrypted with the
session key and incorporate nonces to prevent replay attacks. Mutual authen-
tication is achieved through encrypted messages exchanged between A and B,
leveraging the established session key and nonces. Despite its early contributions,
the original protocol exhibited vulnerabilities, notably the reflection attack. In
response, refined versions have emerged, such as the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe
[16] and Otway-Rees protocols [13].
The description of the Needham-Schroeder public key protocol is often slimmed
down to the three following actions:
Alice−→Bob:message (na:a)pkb
Bob−→Alice :message (na:nb)pka
Alice−→Bob:message (nb)pkb
where each transition of the form X→Y:mrepresents message mbeing sent
